# Bacteria_analysis

## Purpose of Analsyis
The purpose of this analysis was to use javascript functions to visualize bacteria data filtered by volunteer test subject. The interactive webpage should be able to allow the user to filter by ID number, and generate three graphs corresponding to the bacteria found in the bellybutton of that volunteer's ID.
